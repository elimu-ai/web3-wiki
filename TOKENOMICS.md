## Past Contributors

The elimu.ai software started out as an open source project in 2015. During the first six years, more than [40 people](https://github.com/elimu-ai/wiki/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#elimuai---open-source-contributors-) made contributions. And 10% of the max token supply was distributed to these past contributors when the `$ELIMU` token was [announced](https://medium.com/elimu-ai/introducing-elimu-our-community-token-7767eebed862) in July 2021.

## Max Supply

The max supply of `$ELIMU` tokens is capped at 387,000,000.

## 10% Per Year

Following the token's launch in July 2021, no more than 10% of the total supply cap can be minted per year. This restriction has been coded into the token's [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe29797910d413281d2821d5d9a989262c8121cc2#code).
