## About elimu.ai
The mission of elimu.ai is to build innovative learning software that empowers out-of-school children to teach themselves basic reading📖, writing✍🏽 and math🔢. You can read more at https://github.com/elimu-ai/wiki#readme

## Organization
The product built by elimu.ai is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), and the organization building it is structured as a non-profit. Any type of income (e.g. donations) or profit will be re-invested into the organization's purpose—solving the global learning crisis.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization
The open source project is organized as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): **Ξlimu DAO**

The *Ξlimu DAO* is the financial layer surrounding the elimu.ai software, enabling contributor coordination, contributor rewards and fundraising. You can learn more about elimu.ai at https://github.com/elimu-ai/wiki.

### What is `$ELIMU`? 💎
